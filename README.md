**School District Performance Analysis**
## Overview
This project aims to analyze the performance metrics of a school district, providing insights into various factors impacting student achievement. By examining district-wide averages, school-specific data, and performance across different spending ranges, school sizes, and school types, we identify key trends and draw meaningful conclusions.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- 'Resources/': Contains the original CSV files for schools and students data.
- 'Summary Results/': Contains the generated summary CSV files.
- 'school_data_analysis.ipynb': Jupyter notebook with the code for data analysis.
- 'README.md': Project documentation (this file).

## Generated Summary Files
The following summary files are generated and saved in the 'Summary Results' folder:

- district_summary.csv: Overall district performance metrics.
- per_school_summary.csv: Key metrics for each school.
- top_schools.csv: Top-performing schools based on overall passing percentage.
- bottom_schools.csv: Lowest-performing schools based on overall passing percentage.
- math_scores_by_grade.csv: Average math scores by grade level for each school.
- reading_scores_by_grade.csv: Average reading scores by grade level for each school.
- spending_summary.csv: School performance based on spending ranges.
- size_summary.csv: School performance based on school size.
- type_summary.csv: School performance based on school type.

## Analysis and Findings
The analysis provided comprehensive insights into the factors influencing student achievement. Key findings include:

Spending and Performance:

1. Schools with higher spending per student tend to have higher average math and reading scores and better overall passing percentages, indicating a positive correlation between spending and academic performance.
School Size and Performance:

2. Smaller schools (with fewer than 1,000 students) generally outperform larger schools, showcasing higher average scores and passing rates. This suggests that smaller school sizes may contribute to a more focused and effective learning environment.
